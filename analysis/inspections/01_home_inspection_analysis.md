### Issue 3.1: Crushed Dryer Vent - FIRE HAZARD
- **Location:** Laundry closet (lower level, hallway)
- **Severity:** CRITICAL
- **Description:** The dryer vent was partially crushed behind the dryer. This restricts air flow and can cause a buildup of lint inside the duct, creating a potential fire hazard.

- **Recommendation:** Repair or replace the damaged section immediately.

### Issue 3.2: Open Incandescent Light Bulb - FIRE HAZARD
- **Location:** Lower hall closet

### Issue 3.3: Unsecured Garbage Disposal Power Cord - ELECTRICAL HAZARD
- **Location:** Kitchen
- **Severity:** CRITICAL

2. **Open incandescent light bulb in closet** - FIRE HAZARD - Replace with enclosed fixture
3. **Unsecured garbage disposal power cord** - ELECTRICAL HAZARD - Secure properly

### WATER HEATER AGE NOTE
The water heater was manufactured in 2012, making it approximately 13 years old at the time of inspection. Standard water heater lifespan is 8-12 years, suggesting replacement may be needed in the near future.

### OVERALL ASSESSMENT
The property is a 40-year-old condominium in generally serviceable condition with several safety issues requiring immediate attention (dryer vent, light fixture, disposal cord) and deferred maintenance items. The most significant concerns are the fire hazards from the crushed dryer vent and open light bulb, the unknown status of circuit breakers that were shut off, and evidence of rodent activity in the attic. The water heater is past its typical lifespan. Many systems (roof, foundation, exterior) are HOA common area responsibility and were not inspected.
