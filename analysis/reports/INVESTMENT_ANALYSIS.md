# Investment Analysis: 641 Centre Court, Alameda, CA 94502

**Analysis Date:** January 30, 2026
**Asking Price:** $895,000
**Property:** 3 bed / 2.5 bath | 1,720 sq ft | Built 1985 (40 years old)
**HOA:** $936.46/month ($11,237/year)
**Best Comparable:** 311 Centre Court sold for $1,000,000 (November 2024)

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Verdict: NEGOTIATE HARD - Proceed with caution and significant financial reserves.**

This property offers value below market comparables ($895K vs $1M for identical floor plan next door), but carries substantial hidden costs that erode the apparent discount. The HOA is critically underfunded (23.6% funded) with a mandatory $2M+ sewer project due by 2027, creating special assessment risk of $14,000-$22,000 per unit. Combined with required flood insurance, recommended earthquake insurance, and likely HOA dues increases of 8-21% by 2027, the true cost of ownership is significantly higher than the asking price suggests. A buyer with $25,000+ emergency reserves who can absorb these costs may find this a reasonable value in a desirable location with excellent schools. A budget-constrained buyer should walk away.

| Crushed Dryer Vent | Fire hazard | Safety - identified in home inspection |
| Open Light Bulb in Closet | Fire hazard | Safety - identified in home inspection |
| Unsecured Disposal Cord | Electrical hazard | Safety - identified in home inspection |
| Broken Window Lift Cord | Seller-disclosed defect | Disclosed by seller on TDS |

### Suggested Negotiation Credits

### Contingencies to Include

1. **Inspection Contingency** - Standard 17 days

### Walk-Away Triggers in Negotiation

- Seller unwilling to address safety items (dryer vent, electrical hazards)
- Insurance quotes exceed $8,000/year combined (flood + earthquake)
- HOA discloses additional undisclosed liabilities
- Chimney inspection reveals major defects
- Seller counters above $900,000 without credits
