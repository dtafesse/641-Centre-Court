**Impact:** These must be repaired immediately before occupancy.

### 5. AGING MECHANICAL SYSTEMS - MODERATE-HIGH

- Has strong financial reserves ($20,000+ emergency fund)
- Is comfortable with higher insurance costs
- Understands HOA financial risks

- Can absorb potential special assessment

**This property may NOT be suitable for a buyer who:**
