## 1. COST VERIFICATION

### Documented Costs Comparison

| Item | FINAL_BUYER_REPORT Amount | Source Document Amount | Source | Status |
|------|---------------------------|------------------------|--------|--------|
| Loose toilets (3) | $585 total | $585 total ($195 x 3) | 2023 Pest Inspection (historic_disclosures_summary.md) | VERIFIED |

### HOA Fees Verified from Doc 38 (HOA Demand)

| Fee Item | Amount | Source | Status |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|
| 2025 Community Assessment (Annual) | $942.96 | HOA Demand Doc 38 | NEW - Not in report |
| 2025 Community Assessment (Monthly) | $78.58 | HOA Demand Doc 38 | NEW - Not in report |
| 2025 Centre Court Assessment (Annual) | $10,294.56 | HOA Demand Doc 38 | NEW - Not in report |
| 2025 Centre Court Assessment (Monthly) | $857.88 | HOA Demand Doc 38 | NEW - Not in report |
| Admin Fees | $150.00 | HOA Demand Doc 38 | NEW - Not in report |
| **Total Amount Due (September HOA Paid)** | **$1,086.46** | HOA Demand Doc 38 | Calculation verified |
| Report states monthly HOA | $936.46 | FINAL_BUYER_REPORT | VERIFIED (matches $78.58 + $857.88) |

**Note:** The HOA Demand document shows the September 2025 amounts. The total monthly HOA dues of $936.46 in the report matches the sum of Community Assessment ($78.58) + Centre Court Assessment ($857.88) = $936.46. VERIFIED CORRECT.

### Costs from BPG Inspection Report (Doc 39 - September 2025)

| Item | Cost Listed | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| All inspection items | NO COSTS DOCUMENTED | BPG report lists issues but NO dollar amounts for repairs |

**Verification Note:** The September 2025 BPG Inspection Report (Doc 39) does NOT contain any repair cost estimates. It only lists Action Items and Consideration Items without associated costs. The FINAL_BUYER_REPORT correctly states that "No other repair costs were documented in the disclosure package."
