## 3. Special Assessments

### Current Special Assessments: **NONE**

Per the HOA Demand document and Reserve Study, there are no outstanding special assessments currently levied against this property.

### Historical Context:
- Centre Court has a **strong tradition against special assessments**, preferring to raise funds through monthly assessments and taking on debt when necessary
- In 2021, the HOA took a $3.3 million loan for siding replacement **instead of** levying a special assessment that would have cost approximately **$29,585 per unit**

### **RISK OF FUTURE SPECIAL ASSESSMENT: HIGH**

Per the Reserve Study, the HOA is at **high risk** of needing a special assessment due to:
1. The mandatory Private Sewer Lateral (PSL) project ($2+ million, due by end of 2027)
2. Current reserve fund is only **23.6% funded**
3. If reserves are not built up sufficiently, a special assessment of **$14,000-$22,000 per unit** could be levied in 2027

## 5. Planned Increases

| Year | Monthly Assessment | Change |
|------|-------------------|--------|
| 2024 | $781.46 | - |
| 2025 | $857.88 | **+9.73%** |

### **WARNING: Potential 2027 Assessment Increase**

The Board has outlined three scenarios for funding the mandatory Private Sewer Lateral project:

1. **Option 1 (Refinance loan):** Could result in **21%+ assessment increase** in 2027 if interest rates are 8%
2. **Option 2 (Special Assessment):** One-time charge of **$14,000-$22,000 per unit**
3. **Option 3 (Current approach - increase reserves now):** Limits 2027 increase to approximately **8%**

The Board is pursuing Option 3 to minimize future shock.

## KEY FINDINGS SUMMARY

### Financial Health Assessment

| Category | Status | Concern Level |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| Monthly Dues | $936.46 | **HIGH** (significantly above average) |
| Percent Funded | 23.6% | **CRITICAL** (weak reserves) |
| Special Assessment Risk | HIGH | **CRITICAL** |
| Current Litigation | 1 active lawsuit | MODERATE (insured) |
| Debt Load | $2.73M siding loan | **HIGH** |
| Upcoming Major Expense | $2M+ PSL project | **CRITICAL** |

### Critical Concerns:

1. **Extremely High Monthly Dues:** $936.46/month is significantly above typical HOA dues. This reflects the community's debt service and aggressive reserve building strategy.

2. **Severely Underfunded Reserves:** At only 23.6% funded (vs. 70%+ recommended), there is a $41,523 deficit per unit. This creates significant financial vulnerability.

3. **Mandatory $2M+ Sewer Project:** The EPA-mandated Private Sewer Lateral project MUST be completed by end of 2027. This is not optional.

4. **Future Assessment Increases Likely:** Plan for:
   - Continued 20% annual increases in reserve funding through 2029
   - Potential 8-21% assessment increase in 2027 depending on interest rates
   - Risk of $14,000-$22,000 special assessment if reserves prove insufficient

5. **Existing $2.73M Debt:** The siding loan at 4.05% requires $24,996/month in payments through approximately 2036.

### Positive Factors:

1. **No Current Special Assessments:** Despite challenges, no special assessment is currently levied.

2. **FHA Certified:** Improves financing options for buyers.

3. **Clean Escrow Inspection:** Property has no architectural violations.

4. **Proactive Board:** The current board is taking aggressive but necessary steps to build reserves and avoid a devastating future special assessment.

5. **Insurance Coverage:** Adequate master policy with standard deductible; pending lawsuit is covered.

6. **Pet-Friendly:** Allows pets with reasonable restrictions.

7. **Rental Allowed:** Flexibility to rent unit if needed.

### Buyer Recommendations:

1. **Budget for increases:** Anticipate monthly dues rising to $1,000-$1,100+ by 2027-2028.

2. **Maintain emergency fund:** Given the 23.6% funding level, be prepared for potential special assessment of up to $22,000.

3. **Obtain HO-6 insurance:** Required by HOA; include earthquake endorsement and loss assessment coverage.

4. **Request full reserve study:** The 30-year projection shows improvement long-term but significant near-term stress.

5. **Attend HOA meetings:** Stay informed about PSL project progress and financing decisions.
