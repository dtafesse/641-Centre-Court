## Asking Price Assessment

### Comparison to Best Comparable

The most relevant comparable is **311 Centre Court**, which has the identical floor plan (3 bed/2.5 bath, 1,720 sq ft) and sold in November 2024:

| Metric | 311 Centre Ct | 641 Centre Ct (Subject) | Difference |
|--------|---------------|-------------------------|------------|
| Sale/List Price | $1,000,000 | $895,000 | -$105,000 (-10.5%) |
| Price/Sq Ft | $581/sq ft | $520/sq ft | -$61/sq ft (-10.5%) |

### Assessment

**The asking price of $895,000 appears BELOW market** based on:

1. **Direct Comparable:** 311 Centre Court (same floor plan) sold for $1,000,000 just 14 months ago - that's $105,000 more than the current asking price.

2. **Above-Asking Sales:** 311 Centre Court sold 9.3% ABOVE its asking price of $915,000, indicating strong buyer demand for this floor plan in Centre Court.

3. **Price Per Square Foot:** At $520/sq ft, the subject property is priced below:
   - The direct comp ($581/sq ft)
   - Alameda condo median ($542/sq ft)
   - Harbor Bay Isle median ($707/sq ft)

### Potential Concerns

However, several factors could explain the lower price:

1. **Market Decline:** Alameda condo prices have declined significantly:
   - Condos down -15.2% year-over-year (Q3 2025)
   - Overall Alameda home prices down 10.3% YoY (Nov 2025)
   - Price per sq ft in 94502 down 8% YoY

2. **Condition:** The subject property may require updates compared to 311 Centre Court which had "newly refurbished hardwood floors"

3. **High HOA:** $936/month is substantial ($11,232/year)

4. **Condo Market Weakness:** Condos are significantly underperforming single-family homes in the Bay Area
