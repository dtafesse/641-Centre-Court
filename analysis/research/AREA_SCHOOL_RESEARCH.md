## School Boundary Considerations

**Important Notes:**

1. **Verify Assignment:** School boundaries can change. Use the [Alameda USD School Site Locator](https://www.schoolsitelocator.com/apps/alameda/) to confirm assigned schools for this specific address.

2. **Capacity-Based Placement:** Living within a school boundary does not guarantee placement. All placements are based on available space in that grade level.

3. **K-8 vs. Middle School:** Bay Farm School serves K-8, which may eliminate the need for a separate middle school transition.

4. **High School Choice:** Alameda has multiple high school options. Contact the district to understand which high school serves Bay Farm Island addresses and whether there are choice/transfer options.

5. **Private School Enrollment:** 26% of K-12 students in the 94502 zip code attend private schools (compared to 10% statewide), indicating strong private school demand in this area.
