## 1. NATURAL HAZARD ZONES

### California Natural Hazard Disclosures Summary

| Hazard Type | Status | Details |
|-------------|--------|---------|
| Special Flood Hazard Area | **IN** | FEMA Zone X (see flood certificate) |
| Area of Potential Flooding/Dam Inundation | **IN** | New Upper San Leandro Dam |
| High/Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone | OUT | Not in fire hazard zone |
| Wildland (Fire) Area | OUT | Not in State Responsibility Area |
| Earthquake Fault Zone | OUT | Not on mapped fault |

---

## 2. FLOOD RISK - **HIGH CONCERN**

### FEMA Flood Zone Determination

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **FEMA Zone** | Zone X |
| **In Special Flood Hazard Area?** | YES (per NHD statement page 1) but NO per SFHDF |
| **NFIP Community** | ALAMEDA, CITY OF |
| **NFIP Community Number** | 060002 |
| **Map Panel Number** | 06001C0251H |
| **Map Effective Date** | 2018-12-21 |
| **Letter of Map Change** | NO |
| **Flood Insurance Required by Lender?** | Likely YES based on NHD disclosure |

### Flood Risk Analysis

**Key Finding:** There is an inconsistency in the documents:
- The Natural Hazard Disclosure Statement (page 1) marks "YES" for Special Flood Hazard Area
- The Standard Flood Hazard Determination Form (page 3) marks "NO" for being in SFHA

**Recommendation:** Clarify with EBMUD and the City of Alameda. The NHD report indicates the property IS in a Special Flood Hazard Area, which would require flood insurance if obtaining a federally-backed mortgage.

### Dam Inundation Risk

- **Status:** IN Area of Potential Flooding
- **Dam:** New Upper San Leandro
- **Implication:** Property could be affected in the unlikely event of dam failure
- **Action Required:** Consider this in emergency planning

### Historical Flooding Concerns

Per the Alameda County Disclosures Advisory:
- Alameda area has high water tables that can cause standing water and poor drainage
- Heavy rains can cause water intrusion issues
- Rising sea levels may impact future flooding

### Insurance Implications

- **Flood insurance IS likely required** if obtaining a federally-backed mortgage
- Under the "Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act of 2014," properties in flood zones may experience **annual premium increases of 18-25%**
- Contact FEMA at www.floodsmart.gov for specific premium information

## 3. EARTHQUAKE RISK - **MODERATE-HIGH CONCERN**

### Seismic Hazard Summary

| Hazard Type | Status | Risk Level |
|-------------|--------|------------|
| Earthquake Fault Zone | OUT | Lower |
| Landslide Seismic Hazard Zone | OUT | Lower |
| **Liquefaction Seismic Hazard Zone** | **IN** | **HIGH** |

### Liquefaction Risk - **SIGNIFICANT**

**Definition:** Liquefaction occurs when water-saturated soil loses strength during earthquake shaking, causing the ground to behave like a liquid.

**Implications for this property:**
1. Foundation damage risk during earthquakes
2. Structures may settle or tilt
3. Underground utilities may be damaged
4. May require special foundation design for any additions

**Recommendations:**
- Obtain a geotechnical inspection before purchase
- Ensure adequate earthquake insurance coverage
- Consider foundation bolting and cripple wall bracing if not already done
- Review "The Homeowner's Guide to Earthquake Safety" (state-required pamphlet)

### Soft-Story Building Assessment

Per the City of Alameda Soft Story Ordinance:
- Multi-unit residential buildings (5+ units) with soft ground floors are subject to seismic retrofit requirements
- This appears to be a single-family home, so likely NOT subject to this ordinance
- Verify with City of Alameda Community Development Department: (510) 747-6850

## 4. FIRE RISK - **LOW**

| Fire Hazard Category | Status |
|---------------------|--------|
| Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone | OUT |

**Implications:**
- No special fire hazard insurance requirements
